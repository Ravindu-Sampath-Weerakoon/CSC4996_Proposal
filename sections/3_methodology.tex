\section[METHODOLOGY AND PROJECT DESIGN]{Methodology and Project Design}

% This section outlines how you will conduct your research.
% It should be detailed enough that another researcher could replicate your study.

\subsection{Overview of the Proposed Methodology/Research Design}

% Provide a high-level summary of your approach.
% You might want to include a system architecture diagram here later.
% Explain whether this is a quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-method study.

\subsection{Data Collection}

% Describe your data sources.
% Are you using a public dataset (e.g., HMOG, UCI)? 
% Or are you collecting your own data? If so, describe the sensors and sampling rate.

\subsection{Ethical Considerations}

% Discuss any ethical issues related to your data or subjects.
% For behavioral biometrics, privacy is a key concern.
% Mention if you have or need IRB approval.

\subsection{Evaluation and Validation}

% How will you measure success?
% metric examples:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{False Acceptance Rate (FAR)}
    \item \textbf{False Rejection Rate (FRR)}
    \item \textbf{Equal Error Rate (EER)}
    \item \textbf{System Latency (ms)}
\end{itemize}
